unpublished(by now) service to find bus/train/airplane tickets in Europe.

You want to go _somewhere_ ? Just pass your location, date, max price for ticket and get results!

Currently searching only for StudentAgency buses.

Currently it parses tons of html pages for one query, and definitely it is bad solution - StudentAgency gives captcha after several queries. I'm looking for other way to get information.

Just a prototype - no styles, no tests - nothing.
